Covers of popular songs. Music with personalized lyrics she&#x27;s written herself. Even her quirky music videos. All that has attracted hundreds of thousands of YouTube subscribers.<br><br>But all those people listening to her music aren&#x27;t enough to pay her rent. Ad revenues on YouTube are a pittance, and Spotify earns her less than $0.00043 a listen. Even digital downloads through iTunes swallow more than 30% of every sale - and each track is locked at $0.99 a download.<br><br>The AXEL Marketplace will remove the intermediaries between Shera and her fans, letting her set her own pricing and earn what she should be earning.<br><br>All she would have to do is select a song or album, set what she thinks it&#x27;s actually worth, and get a link she can put anywhere. Using an AXEL link instead of one for iTunes would instantly boost her earnings by a huge margin with a few moments work. No more paying a fortune to the middleman - fans will finally be able to support her without jumping through hoops. AXEL will let artists like Shera reap the full benefits of their work.</p></div></article><article id="story-tina" class="profile grid-x align-center align-top small-up-1 medium-up-2"><div id="photo" class="cell small-order-1 medium-order-2 padding-none height-50-mobile overflow-hidden"><img src="assets/stories/large-tina.cfc39270c4.png" alt="Tina is a gaming influencer-Tina is a gaming influencer..."> <svg class="block-cap bottom svg-white emergence-ignore-child" preserveAspectRatio="none" viewBox="0 0 1024 100" aria-hidden="true"><polygon points="512 100 1024 100 1024 0 512 100"/><polygon points="0 100 512 100 0 0 0 100"/></svg></div><div id="description" class="cell small-order-2 medium-order-1 padding-tb-lg padding-lr-md"><h1 id="dialog-title" class="h2 font-copy text-secondary header-left header-secondary">Tina is a gaming influencer</h1><p id="dialog-description">Gaming is the biggest entertainment industry and Tina likes to game.
