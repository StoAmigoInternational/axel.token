	<p>
	These are our terms of use. We have tried to state them clearly and simply. By using AXEL you are agreeing to these terms of use. If you don't like what you read, please don't use AXEL – it's that simple. If we update these terms in the future we will post them here, so please check in from time to time.<br><br>

	You are also agreeing to our Privacy Policy, which is provided below.<br><br>

	There are additional important "legal stuff" in the Terms and Conditions that you should also be aware of, so check them out. By using AXEL you are agreeing to these Terms and Conditions, as well.<br><br>
	You have read and understand:<br><br>

	You may only use AXEL if you are thirteen years of age or over.<br><br>

	You are responsible for all activities that occur while using or as a result of your use of AXEL. We do not monitor, inspect, audit or track your digital content, but we reserve the right to revoke your access to AXEL if you don't play nicely with others. We won't put up with things like harassment, intimidation, causing harm to others or just general bullying. We also have a strong distaste for fraud or scams, so don't do these things while using AXEL. We're not trying to be hard to get along with here, we just want everyone to have a great experience.<br><br>

	We ask that you follow a few simple rules, including only using AXEL for content that you have the right to use. Photos you took? That's okay. Documents that you created? Sure. Hollywood blockbuster movie that you downloaded from a bit torrent site? We highly recommend that you check with your legal counsel first.<br><br>

	We DO NOT sell or rent your personal information to anyone for any purpose. We do not harvest your data to bother you with advertising. Very simply, we don't track or let others use or view your personal information. We will, however, make whatever disclosures we must to comply with the law, and if you don't like that, we suggest you occupy Congress.<br><br>

	Everything that you save in using AXEL stays yours. We realize that's a crazy concept. AXEL only does the things that you ask it to do with your content. You are in control. See our <a href="https://axel.org/privacy-bill-of-rights" target="_blank" class="text-secondary text-accent-hover text-bold external" rel="noopener">Privacy Bill of Rights</a>.<br><br>

	We will terminate your account if we find that you are doing anything illegal with AXEL. Whatever else you do is your own business, not ours. Don't tell us, we won't ask. If we provide a trial account, you will have no access to the account at the end of the trial period unless you upgrade it to a paid account before the trial period ends. If we provide an account with free storage space, we reserve the right to change the amount of free storage space available and even take it all back in the future. Any account that is inactive for 90 days is subject to termination, unless: 1) it is a paid account and your payment is current or 2) it has a AXEL personal cloud device connected to the account.<br><br>
		
	If your account is terminated, please don't ask us for your data. We are not liable for your data if your account is terminated. We are also not responsible for any loss of data for any reason; if it's important, please back it up.<br><br>
		
	If your copyrighted work is accessible on or through AXEL and you believe it has been used in a way that constitutes copyright infringement, you may notify our <a href="https://axel.org/copyright" target="_blank" class="text-secondary text-accent-hover text-bold external" rel="noopener">copyright agent</a>.<br><br>
		
	Lastly, AXEL provides many features and services at no cost to you. At some point in the future we may introduce advertising, as we do have to keep the lights on. If we do make such changes, we trust that you will understand the need to do so.<br><br>
		
	We may make changes to the Terms of Use and/or Terms and Conditions as necessary and any changes will be posted prominently on our website. By using AXEL, you agree to be bound by our Terms of Use and/or Terms and Conditions as amended. Thanks for reading. If you have any questions let us know, but we think this is pretty straightforward stuff.<br><br><br>
